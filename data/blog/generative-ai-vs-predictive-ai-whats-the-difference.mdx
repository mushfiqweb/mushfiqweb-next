## Definitions

- **Generative AI**  
  Models that learn the distribution of data and can produce new samples: e.g., LLMs for text, diffusion models for images, code assistants for programming, and multimodal systems for mixed inputs/outputs.

- **Predictive AI**  
  Models that map inputs to an outcome: e.g., classification (spam vs. not), regression (demand forecast), ranking (recommendations), and anomaly detection. These do not create new artifacts; they estimate what’s likely.

## How They Work (At A Glance)

- Generative AI

  - Common families: transformer LLMs, diffusion models, VAEs, autoregressive sequence models
  - Training style: self-supervised/pretraining on massive corpora, then fine-tuning or prompting
  - Output: probabilistic content generation guided by context, instructions, or examples

- Predictive AI
  - Common families: gradient-boosted trees, linear/logistic regression, random forests, shallow/modern neural networks
  - Training style: supervised learning on labeled datasets; sometimes semi/weakly supervised
  - Output: numeric scores, probabilities, or discrete labels tied to KPIs

## Inputs and Outputs

- Generative

  - Inputs: prompts, documents, images, audio, code, structured context
  - Outputs: net-new text, images, audio, code, or structured content (e.g., JSON)

- Predictive
  - Inputs: tabular features, time series, event logs, encoded text/images
  - Outputs: predictions (e.g., likelihood of churn), forecasts, classifications, rankings

## Typical Use Cases

- Generative

  - Content creation: marketing copy, product descriptions, documentation
  - Knowledge tasks: summarization, Q&A, drafting emails/tickets
  - Design/code: UI mockups, code generation, test creation
  - Multimodal: image generation/editing, audio synthesis, video captions

- Predictive
  - Business outcomes: demand forecasting, lead scoring, churn prediction
  - Risk & compliance: fraud detection, credit scoring, anomaly alerts
  - Operations: predictive maintenance, capacity planning
  - Personalization: recommendations, next-best-action

## Evaluating Quality

- Generative metrics

  - Text: human eval, task success rate, BLEU/ROUGE (for some tasks), factuality/hallucination rate
  - Images/audio: human eval, task-specific criteria; consistency/faithfulness
  - Safety: toxicity, PII leakage, policy adherence

- Predictive metrics
  - Classification: accuracy, precision/recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC
  - Regression/forecast: RMSE/MAE/MAPE, calibration
  - Ranking: NDCG/MRR, hit-rate, lift

## Risks and Governance

- Generative risks

  - Hallucinations, brand/safety violations, IP concerns
  - Data leakage through prompts or training sets
  - Overreliance without human review

- Predictive risks
  - Bias in training data, poor generalization, model drift
  - Data quality issues, feature leakage
  - Miscalibration leading to bad decisions

Mitigation patterns:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounding generative answers
- Human-in-the-loop review for high-stakes content or decisions
- MLOps: monitoring drift, data checks, audit trails, explainability

## Cost and Latency Profiles

- Generative: can be compute-heavy (especially large models and long outputs); latency varies with context length and modality. Caching and smaller models help.
- Predictive: often lower latency and cost per prediction; efficient for large-scale batch or streaming use.

## Decision Checklist

Use **Generative AI** when:

- You need net-new content or creative artifacts
- Tasks are open-ended (summarize, brainstorm, draft, translate)
- Acceptable outputs are “good enough” with human review and policy checks
- You can provide grounding context (RAG) to reduce hallucinations

Use **Predictive AI** when:

- You need a clear numeric/label outcome tied to KPIs
- Data is structured/time-series and labeled
- You must optimize accuracy, calibration, and operational reliability
- Decisions influence transactions, risk, or resource allocation

When in doubt, consider a **hybrid**:

- Predictive model identifies candidates; generative model drafts tailored content
- Generative model proposes actions; predictive scoring ranks them for execution
- Predictive classifiers gate generative responses for safety

## Integration Patterns

- Generative

  - Prompt engineering, tool-use (function calling), and RAG with vector search
  - Content moderation and policy filters
  - Workflow orchestration with human approval steps

- Predictive
  - Feature pipelines, model registries, CI/CD for models, monitoring and alerts
  - A/B testing and incremental rollouts
  - Explainability for regulated domains

## Getting Started

1. Define the outcome: net-new content vs. forecast/classification
2. Map to evaluation: human eval and safety checks vs. precision/recall/ROC-AUC
3. Assess data: unlabeled corpora for generative; labeled, governed datasets for predictive
4. Start small: pilot with clear success criteria, track real-world performance
5. Add guardrails: grounding, moderation, and human-in-the-loop where needed
6. Operationalize: observability, versioning, and continuous improvement
