The internet is a global network of networks that connects billions of computers and devices. It enables browsing, email, streaming, and real‑time communication by coordinating layers of technologies that move data reliably and securely.

## Overview

- Network of networks interconnected by routers and ISPs
- Data travels as small packets that may take different paths
- Protocols define addressing, transport, security, and application behavior
- DNS resolves human‑readable domains to IP addresses
- The Web runs on HTTP; security is provided by TLS (HTTPS)
- Performance is shaped by latency, bandwidth, and congestion

## Packets, Routing, and Reliability

- Applications break messages into packets; each packet carries source/destination IPs.
- Routers forward packets using routing tables; paths can change due to congestion or failures.
- Time To Live (TTL) prevents packets from circulating forever.
- Reliability is handled above IP: TCP reorders, detects loss, and retransmits; UDP trades reliability for lower latency.
- On the public internet, inter‑domain routing uses BGP so networks can choose economical and resilient paths.

## IP Addresses and DNS

- IPv4 (e.g., `192.0.2.172`) and IPv6 (e.g., `2001:db8::1`) identify devices; subnets and NAT organize local networks.
- DNS flow: your resolver queries root → TLD → authoritative nameserver to get records.
- Caching honors TTL to reduce latency and load.
- Common records: `A/AAAA` map names to IPs, `CNAME` aliases names, `MX` routes mail, `TXT` carries metadata (e.g., SPF/verification).

## Transport: TCP, UDP, and QUIC

- TCP adds reliability via the three‑way handshake (SYN/SYN‑ACK/ACK), acknowledgments, sliding windows, and congestion control (e.g., slow start).
- UDP is connectionless and used where minimal latency matters (streaming, real‑time).
- QUIC (over UDP) provides transport‑level encryption and multiplexing; HTTP/3 uses QUIC to reduce head‑of‑line blocking.

## HTTP and the Web

- HTTP defines methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.), status codes, headers, and bodies.
- HTTP/1.1 uses persistent connections; HTTP/2 multiplexes streams over one connection; HTTP/3 runs over QUIC.
- Typical page load:
  - Resolve domain via DNS
  - Connect/handshake (TCP or QUIC)
  - Negotiate TLS for HTTPS
  - Send request (method, path, headers)
  - Receive response (status, headers, body)
- Caching uses headers like `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified` to avoid redundant transfers.

## HTTPS and TLS

- HTTPS = HTTP over TLS for confidentiality, integrity, and server authentication.
- Certificates chain from a leaf to intermediates to a trusted root CA; browsers verify the chain and hostname (via SNI).
- Ephemeral key exchange enables perfect forward secrecy; OCSP/CRL check revocation; HSTS enforces HTTPS.

## Physical Infrastructure

- Bits travel over fiber, copper, and radio (Wi‑Fi/cellular); last‑mile connects homes/offices to ISP access networks.
- Backbones and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) interconnect ISPs; peering reduces cost and improves performance.
- CDNs place content close to users to cut round‑trip times and offload origins.

## What Developers Should Optimize

- Timeouts, retries with exponential backoff, and idempotent operations.
- Connection reuse, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, and gzip/brotli compression.
- Effective caching: far‑future caches for static assets, validators for dynamic.
- DNS records and TTLs aligned with deploy strategy; use CNAMEs and health checks.
- Observability: logs, metrics, tracing; measure latency, errors, and throughput.
- Security hygiene: HTTPS everywhere, strong ciphers, certificate automation.
